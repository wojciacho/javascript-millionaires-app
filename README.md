# Javascript Small Project

## Vanilla Javascript

Simple project built in Vanilla Javascript. It is a random millionaire app.
This app is adding random user with random money.
You can sort users, add, delete, calculate total.
If you want to delete user just left click on name.
I used the fetch method to request data from a server.
* Server I used: https://randomuser.me/api/
